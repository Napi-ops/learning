# Napi's Learing Repository!

#### MyPractice Part

​	It will contain all my OJ code and mini projects written in college. At present it includes my code written in  2019 autumn, 2020 spring and 2020 autumn. Among these codes I think the Assembler and Huffman Compress are quite ininteretsing. You can see them in 2020 autumn code.

#### MyTemplate Part

​	It has some simple data structure templates written in c++. In 2020 autumn I have the Data Structure Class, but in this class we just use the c pesudo code. So I want to write my own templates in c++ to improve myself. And, it's also a cool thing I think. I will also keep updating it.

#### OCR_Test Part

​	Well, it's a project that I should finnish in 2020 spring. I do finish the code in 2020 spring festival and it works quite good. But due to the pandemic, we have to take the online class for an entire semester. And my tutor seems to be out of contact. So ... this project is abandoned. But I have to say it's a really amzing project. Originally in this project I want to make a machine which can help us with our homework. You just need to put your homework in this machine and sleep for a while, and when you wake up, your homework has already been finished. I write the code which can scan the homework and print the answer in the image. And I also find the machine that can write word as a human write it in TaoBao. But our tutor, he just disappeared... All in all, maybe one day in the future I will finish the prohect myself. And, I really learn a lot from this project.

#### Snake(FPGA) Part

​	It's another interesting project that I finished in 2020 autumn. It's a game that can played in a monitor. But you should first write the bitstream in FPGA, because I write it in Verilog HDL. I didn't finish it all my own. In fact I refer to some code in CSDN. But I didn't copy any code. All these code were written word by word. This project is a little difficult and it costs me almost a week. But I do learn a lot from it, such as how the VGA works and how too use the FPGA. From this project I also have a better understanding of Verilog (Although I have to say Veribug is really a junk). 

#### HuaWei_Competiton_2021 Part

​	During 2021.3.14~2021.3.27 I joined a match organized by Huawei(You can see it in [here](https://competition.huaweicloud.com/codecraft2021#introduction)(I'm not sure whether it's still effective now)). And from this competition I really learn a lot, although our group didn't get a good rank. I write my experience in this part's document so in here I don't want to say too much. You can find my whole process in this part.
